#### Introduction
Welcome to the **ICD9 code extraction from Wikipedia project**ðŸ“‘!

According to CDC, The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of mortality statistics.
The ICD has been revised periodically to incorporate changes in the medical field. To date, there have been 10 revisions of the ICD.


I learned about ICD9 code from my previous job working as a biomedical data analyst/ annotator in NHRI, Taiwan last year. I was working on a project (Taiwan cancer registry project)and got to know more about cancer staging classification according to the AJCC system. It got me thinking that it would be fun and efficient to use some Python codes to extract important tables like ICD-9 codes.
